# UNIX-Timestamp-Utility
Utility for converting date/time to and from UNIX timestamps and renaming files to UNIX timestamps.

Future Plans:

- Deal with directories - rename all files inside after confirmation
- Change potential error unwraps and unreachables to exit codes
- Combine Generate and Check commands - automatically detect whether DateTime or Unix timestamp.
